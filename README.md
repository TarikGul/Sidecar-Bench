## Sidecar Bench

Benchmarking for Substrate-API-Sidecar

### TODO

* Need to add my step by step instructions on launching the GCP instance and setting up the enviornment to run the scripts. Currently I have it configured for a GCP instance in my own personal account. Next is to setup one via the Parity GCP developer hub. Then setup a CI workflow with a docker container via github actions to run the benchmarks.

* Additional routes to the data field and add a weight to blocks queries

* Update the `README.md` inside of the `benchmarking/gcp-instance` directory with specs and hardware

* Dockerfile

* Github actions
